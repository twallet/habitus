4. If using GitHub, authorize Railway to access your repositories
5. Complete any onboarding steps

**Verification:**

- ✅ You can log into Railway dashboard
- ✅ You see the Railway dashboard home page
- ✅ GitHub is connected (if using GitHub signup)

**STOP HERE** - Verify you can access Railway dashboard before proceeding.---

### Step 1.2: Create Cloudinary Account

**Action:** Create a Cloudinary account and get API credentials**Detailed Instructions:**

1. Go to https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free
2. Fill out the registration form:

- Email address
- Password
- Full name

- ✅ You've saved all three credentials

**STOP HERE** - Save credentials before proceeding.---

### Step 1.3: Set Up Railway PostgreSQL Database (Optional - Can Do Later)

**Action:** Note that Railway PostgreSQL will be set up in Step 3.1**Why Railway PostgreSQL:**

- **Included in Railway** - No separate account needed
- **Free tier** - Covered by Railway's $5/month credit
- **Simple setup** - Just add a service in Railway dashboard
- **Integrated** - Works seamlessly with Railway web service

**Note:** We'll create the PostgreSQL database service in Railway in Step 3.1 when we set up the project. **Important:** Railway does NOT automatically link the database to your web service. You will need to:

- Create the PostgreSQL service (Step 3.1)
- Manually link PostgreSQL variables to your web service (Step 3.1.1)
- Construct `DATABASE_URL` from individual PostgreSQL variables (Step 3.3)

**You can skip this step for now** - We'll do it in Step 3.1 when creating the Railway project.**STOP HERE** - You can proceed to Phase 2 (Code Updates) or wait until Step 3.1 to set up the database.---

## PHASE 2: Code Updates (Environment-Aware)

### Step 2.1: Update Port Configuration

**Action:** Make port handling support both `PORT` (Railway) and `VITE_PORT` (dev)**Files to modify:**

- `backend/src/setup/constants.ts`

**Changes needed:**

- Check for `PORT` environment variable first (Railway standard)
- Fallback to `VITE_PORT` if `PORT` not set (development)
- Update JSDoc comments in English
- Ensure error messages are in English

**Test after this step:**

- Run `npm run dev` locally - should still work with `VITE_PORT`
- Verify no errors in console

**STOP HERE** - Test local development still works.---

### Step 2.2: Add Database Dependencies

**Action:** Add PostgreSQL support packages**Files to modify:**

- `backend/package.json`

**Changes needed:**

- Add `pg` dependency (PostgreSQL client for Railway PostgreSQL)
- Add `@types/pg` as dev dependency
- Keep `sqlite3` (still needed for development)

**Commands:**

```bash
cd backend
npm install pg
npm install --save-dev @types/pg
```

**Test after this step:**

- Run `npm install` in root directory
- Verify no installation errors
- Verify `sqlite3` still works locally

**STOP HERE** - Verify dependencies install correctly.---

### Step 2.3: Update Database Class for Environment-Aware Support

**Action:** Make database.ts support both SQLite (dev) and PostgreSQL (Supabase) (prod)**Files to modify:**

- `backend/src/db/database.ts`

**Changes needed:**

- Detect database type: Check for `DATABASE_URL` → PostgreSQL (Railway), otherwise → SQLite
- Create separate connection logic for each database type
- Create separate schema creation for each (PostgreSQL vs SQLite syntax)
- Update all methods to work with both database types
- Add JSDoc comments in English
- Ensure error messages are in English
- Remove any dead code

**Key differences to handle:**

- PostgreSQL (Railway): `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`, `TIMESTAMP`, no `PRAGMA`
- SQLite: `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`, `DATETIME`, `PRAGMA` statements
- Connection: PostgreSQL uses connection pool, SQLite uses file path
- Return values: PostgreSQL `RETURNING` clause, SQLite `lastID`

**Test after this step:**

- Run `npm run dev` locally - should still use SQLite
- Run tests: `npm test` - all tests should pass
- Check for dead code in modified file

**STOP HERE** - Verify local development and tests still work.---

### Step 2.4: Add Cloudinary Dependency

**Action:** Add Cloudinary package**Files to modify:**

- `backend/package.json`

**Changes needed:**

- Add `cloudinary` dependency

**Commands to run:**

```bash
cd backend
npm install cloudinary
```

**Test after this step:**

- Run `npm install` in root directory
- Verify no installation errors

**STOP HERE** - Verify dependency installs correctly.---

### Step 2.5: Update Upload Middleware for Environment-Aware Support

**Action:** Make upload.ts support both local storage (dev) and Cloudinary (prod)**Files to modify:**

- `backend/src/middleware/upload.ts`
- `backend/src/server.ts` (may need updates for static file serving)

**Changes needed:**

- Detect storage type: Check for `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` → Cloudinary, otherwise → local
- Create separate upload logic for each:
- Development: Continue using `multer.diskStorage`
- Production: Use Cloudinary SDK `uploader.upload()`
- Return appropriate URLs:
- Development: `/uploads/filename.jpg`
- Production: Cloudinary URL `https://res.cloudinary.com/...`
- Update static file serving in `server.ts`:
- Development: Keep `/uploads` route
- Production: Remove or conditionally disable `/uploads` route
- Add JSDoc comments in English
- Ensure error messages are in English
- Remove any dead code

**Test after this step:**

- Run `npm run dev` locally - should still use local file storage
- Test file upload locally - should save to `data/uploads/`
- Run tests: `npm test` - all tests should pass
- Check for dead code in modified files

**STOP HERE** - Verify local file uploads still work.---

### Step 2.6: Test Production Database Locally (Optional but Recommended)

**Action:** Test Railway PostgreSQL connection locally before deploying**Prerequisites:**

- Railway PostgreSQL database created (from Step 1.3 or Step 3.1)
- Connection string from Railway

**Instructions:**

1. In Railway dashboard, go to your PostgreSQL service
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. Find `DATABASE_URL` - this is your connection string
4. Copy the connection string
5. Set `DATABASE_URL` in `config/.env` temporarily:
   ```javascript
         DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@containers-us-west-xxx.railway.app:5432/railway
   ```

(Your actual connection string will be different)

6. Run the app: `npm run dev`
7. Verify it connects and creates schema
8. Remove `DATABASE_URL` from `.env` after testing (to go back to SQLite for local dev)

**Test after this step:**

- App connects to Railway PostgreSQL successfully
- Schema is created correctly
- Basic operations work
- Remove production credentials from `.env` after testing

**STOP HERE** - Verify Railway PostgreSQL connection works (optional step).---

### Step 2.7: Test Cloudinary Locally (Optional but Recommended)

**Action:** Test Cloudinary uploads locally before deploying**Prerequisites:**

- Cloudinary credentials from Step 1.2

**Instructions:**

1. Add to `config/.env` temporarily:

   ```javascript
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = your_cloud_name;
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = your_api_key;
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = your_api_secret;
   ```

2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Test uploading a profile picture
4. Verify file appears in Cloudinary dashboard
5. Remove Cloudinary vars from `.env` after testing

**Test after this step:**

- File uploads to Cloudinary successfully
- URL is returned correctly
- File appears in Cloudinary media library

**STOP HERE** - Verify Cloudinary uploads work (optional step).---

### Step 2.8: Run Full Test Suite

**Action:** Ensure all tests pass after code changes**Commands:**

```bash
npm test
```

**Verification:**

- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ No new test failures
- ✅ Code coverage maintained

**STOP HERE** - Fix any test failures before proceeding.---

## PHASE 3: Railway Deployment Configuration

### Step 3.1: Create New Project on Railway

**Action:** Create a new Railway project, add PostgreSQL database, and connect your GitHub repository**Detailed Instructions:**

1. In Railway dashboard, click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. If not connected, authorize Railway to access your GitHub account
4. Select your repository: `habitus` (or your repo name)
5. Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js project
6. **Add PostgreSQL database:**

- In the project, click "New" → "Database" → "Add PostgreSQL"
- Name it `habitus-db` (or your preferred name)
- Railway will create the PostgreSQL service
- **Note:** Railway does NOT automatically link the database to your web service - you need to do this manually (see Step 3.1.1 below)

7. Click "Deploy Now" (we'll configure it properly in next steps)

**Note:** Railway will start deploying, but we'll configure environment variables and settings before it completes.**Verification:**

- ✅ Project is created on Railway
- ✅ PostgreSQL database service is created and linked
- ✅ GitHub repository is connected
- ✅ Initial deployment has started

**STOP HERE** - Don't worry if deployment fails, we'll configure it properly next.---

### Step 3.1.1: Link PostgreSQL Database to Web Service

**Action:** Manually link the PostgreSQL database service to your web service so `DATABASE_URL` is available**Detailed Instructions:**

1. In your Railway project dashboard, you should see two services:

   - Your web service (named after your repo, e.g., `habitus`)
   - Your PostgreSQL database service (e.g., `habitus-db`)

2. **Link `DATABASE_URL` from PostgreSQL service to your web service:**

   Railway provides `DATABASE_URL` directly from the PostgreSQL service. You just need to reference it:

   - Click on your **web service** (not the database)
   - Go to the **"Variables"** tab
   - Click **"New Variable"** → **"Add Reference"** (or similar option)
   - Select your PostgreSQL database service (e.g., `habitus-db`)
   - Select `DATABASE_URL` from the available variables
   - Railway will automatically create the reference with the value: `${{habitus-db.DATABASE_URL}}`
   - Replace `habitus-db` with your actual database service name if different

3. **Alternative method (if reference doesn't work):**

   If Railway doesn't provide `DATABASE_URL` directly, you can construct it from individual PostgreSQL variables:

   - Reference individual variables: `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`
   - Create `DATABASE_URL` manually:
     - Variable Name: `DATABASE_URL`
     - Value: `postgresql://${{POSTGRES_USER}}:${{POSTGRES_PASSWORD}}@${{POSTGRES_HOST}}:${{POSTGRES_PORT}}/${{POSTGRES_DB}}`

4. **Verify the link:**
   - In your web service → "Variables" tab
   - You should see `DATABASE_URL` listed
   - The value should be: `${{habitus-db.DATABASE_URL}}` (or your database service name)
   - Railway will automatically resolve this to the actual connection string at runtime

**Important Notes:**

- Railway does NOT automatically link services - you must do this manually
- Railway provides `DATABASE_URL` directly from the PostgreSQL service
- The reference value will be: `${{your-db-service-name.DATABASE_URL}}`
- Railway automatically resolves this reference to the actual connection string at runtime
- Replace `your-db-service-name` with your actual PostgreSQL service name (e.g., `habitus-db`)

**Verification:**

- ✅ `DATABASE_URL` appears in your web service's Variables tab
- ✅ The value is: `${{habitus-db.DATABASE_URL}}` (or your database service name)
- ✅ Railway will automatically resolve this to the actual connection string at runtime
- ✅ The resolved connection string format is: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`

**STOP HERE** - Verify `DATABASE_URL` is linked to your web service before proceeding.---

### Step 3.2: Configure Build and Start Commands

**Action:** Set up build and start commands for Railway**Detailed Instructions:**

1. In your Railway project, click on the service (should be named after your repo)
2. Go to "Settings" tab
3. Scroll to "Build & Deploy" section
4. Configure:

- **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `cd backend && npm start`
- **Root Directory**: Leave empty (root of repo)

5. Click "Save"

**Alternative: Create `railway.json` (Optional)**You can also create a `railway.json` file in project root:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "npm install && npm run build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "cd backend && npm start",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

**Verification:**

- ✅ Build and start commands are configured
- ✅ Settings are saved

**STOP HERE** - Verify build/start commands are set correctly.---

### Step 3.3: Configure Environment Variables in Railway

**Action:** Set all required environment variables in Railway dashboard**Detailed Instructions:**

1. In your Railway service, go to "Variables" tab
2. Click "New Variable" for each variable below
3. Add the following variables one by one:

**Note:** The backticks below are just for documentation formatting. In Railway, enter the variable name and value WITHOUT backticks.

**Required Variables:**

- Variable Name: `NODE_ENV` → Value: `production`
- Variable Name: `TRUST_PROXY` → Value: `true`
- Variable Name: `VITE_SERVER_URL` → Value: `https://habitus.nextstepslab.com`
- Variable Name: `VITE_PORT` → Value: `${{PORT}}` (this references Railway's PORT variable)
- Variable Name: `PROJECT_ROOT` → Value: `/app` (Railway's project path)

**Example:** When adding `NODE_ENV`:

- In Railway's "Variable Name" field, enter: `NODE_ENV` (without backticks)
- In Railway's "Value" field, enter: `production` (without backticks)

**Database (Railway PostgreSQL - Manual Link Required):**

Railway provides `DATABASE_URL` directly from the PostgreSQL service. You just need to reference it in your web service.

**Link `DATABASE_URL` from PostgreSQL service:**

1. Go to your **web service** → "Variables" tab
2. Click "New Variable" → "Add Reference"
3. Select your PostgreSQL database service (e.g., `habitus-db`)
4. Select `DATABASE_URL` from the available variables
5. Railway will automatically create the reference with value: `${{habitus-db.DATABASE_URL}}`
   - Replace `habitus-db` with your actual database service name if different

**Alternative: Construct `DATABASE_URL` from individual variables (if reference doesn't work):**

If Railway doesn't provide `DATABASE_URL` directly, you can construct it:

1. Reference individual PostgreSQL variables: `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`
2. Create `DATABASE_URL` manually:
   - Variable Name: `DATABASE_URL`
   - Value: `postgresql://${{POSTGRES_USER}}:${{POSTGRES_PASSWORD}}@${{POSTGRES_HOST}}:${{POSTGRES_PORT}}/${{POSTGRES_DB}}`

**Verification:**

- ✅ `DATABASE_URL` exists in your web service's Variables tab
- ✅ The value is: `${{habitus-db.DATABASE_URL}}` (or your database service name)
- ✅ Railway will automatically resolve this to the actual connection string at runtime
- ✅ The resolved connection string format is: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`

**JWT & Auth:**

- Variable Name: `JWT_SECRET` → Value: [Generate a secure random string, e.g., use `openssl rand -hex 32`]
- Variable Name: `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` → Value: `7d`
- Variable Name: `MAGIC_LINK_EXPIRY_MINUTES` → Value: `15`
- Variable Name: `MAGIC_LINK_COOLDOWN_MINUTES` → Value: `5`

**Email (SMTP/API):**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Railway SMTP Limitation**

According to [Railway's documentation](https://docs.railway.com/reference/outbound-networking), **SMTP is only available on Pro plan and above**. Free, Trial, and Hobby plans have SMTP disabled to prevent spam and abuse.

**For Free/Trial/Hobby plans**, you must use transactional email services with HTTPS APIs instead of SMTP.

**Recommended Options:**

**Option 1A: Brevo API (Recommended for Free plans - 300 emails/day free, uses HTTPS API)**

**✅ Now supported!** The codebase supports Brevo API for Free/Trial/Hobby plans.

1. Sign up at https://www.brevo.com (free account)
2. Go to Settings → SMTP & API → API Keys
3. Create an API key (not your account password)
4. Verify your sender email/domain in Brevo (Settings → Senders)

   - Variable Name: `SMTP_HOST` → Value: `smtp-relay.brevo.com`
   - Variable Name: `SMTP_PORT` → Value: `587`
   - Variable Name: `SMTP_USER` → Value: [Your Brevo SMTP identifier, e.g., `9ddfce001@smtp-brevo.com` OR your Brevo account email]
   - Variable Name: `SMTP_PASS` → Value: [Your SMTP key from Brevo]
   - Variable Name: `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL` → Value: [Verified sender email, e.g., `habitus@nextstepslab.com`] (optional - if not set, uses SMTP_USER)
   - Variable Name: `SMTP_FROM_NAME` → Value: `🌱 Habitus` (optional - display name for sender)

**Option 2: Resend (Railway's Recommended - Free tier: 3,000 emails/month, uses HTTPS API)**

**⚠️ Note:** The current codebase only supports SMTP. To use Resend API, you need to either:

- Upgrade to Railway Pro plan (to use SMTP), OR
- Implement Resend API support in the codebase (see Resend API documentation: https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/emails/send-email)

1. Sign up at https://resend.com (free account)
2. Go to API Keys and create a new API key
3. Verify your domain or use their test domain
4. Configure in Railway (once API support is implemented):
   - Variable Name: `RESEND_API_KEY` → Value: [Your Resend API key]
   - Variable Name: `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL` → Value: [Verified sender email]
   - Variable Name: `SMTP_FROM_NAME` → Value: `🌱 Habitus` (optional)

**Option 3: Gmail SMTP (Pro plan only - requires app password)**

**⚠️ Only works on Railway Pro plan or above. SMTP is blocked on Free/Trial/Hobby plans.**

- Variable Name: `SMTP_HOST` → Value: `smtp.gmail.com`
- Variable Name: `SMTP_PORT` → Value: `587`
- Variable Name: `SMTP_USER` → Value: [Your Gmail address]
- Variable Name: `SMTP_PASS` → Value: [Gmail app password - generate at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords]

- Variable Name: `SMTP_HOST` → Value: [Your SMTP host]
- Variable Name: `SMTP_PORT` → Value: `587` (or `465` for SSL)
- Variable Name: `SMTP_USER` → Value: [Your SMTP username/email]
- Variable Name: `SMTP_PASS` → Value: [Your SMTP password]

**Summary:**

- **Free/Trial/Hobby plans:** SMTP is blocked. You must use HTTPS API services. **✅ Brevo API is now supported!** You can also implement support for Resend, SendGrid, Mailgun, or Postmark.
- **Pro plan and above:** SMTP is available. You can use any SMTP provider (Brevo SMTP, Gmail, custom SMTP server, etc.).

**Current Status:**

- ✅ **Brevo API is supported** - Works on all Railway plans (Free, Trial, Hobby, Pro)
- ✅ **SMTP is supported** - Works on Railway Pro plan and above
- ⚠️ **Resend API** - Not yet implemented (can be added if needed)

- Variable Name: `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` → Value: [Your Perplexity API key]
- Variable Name: `PERPLEXITY_MODEL` → Value: `sonar`

3. Mark sensitive variables (JWT_SECRET, SMTP_PASS, CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET, DATABASE_URL) as "Secret" by toggling the lock icon

**Generate JWT_SECRET:**Run this command locally to generate a secure secret:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Copy the output and use it as `JWT_SECRET`.**Important Notes:**

- Railway automatically provides `PORT` environment variable
- Railway provides individual PostgreSQL variables (`POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, etc.) that must be manually linked
- You need to construct `DATABASE_URL` from these variables (see Step 3.1.1 and Step 3.3)
- Use `${{PORT}}` syntax to reference Railway's PORT in VITE_PORT
- Use `${{VARIABLE_NAME}}` syntax to reference other Railway variables
- All secrets are encrypted in Railway

**Verification:**

- ✅ All required environment variables are set
- ✅ `DATABASE_URL` is present in your web service's Variables tab (manually linked from Step 3.1.1)
- ✅ Sensitive values are marked as secrets (lock icon)
- ✅ No typos in variable names

**STOP HERE** - Verify all environment variables are configured correctly.---

1. Wait 5-30 minutes for DNS propagation
2. Check DNS propagation:
   ```bash
            nslookup habitus.nextstepslab.com
            # or
            dig habitus.nextstepslab.com
   ```

Should return the Railway IP or hostname

3. In Railway dashboard, check "Domains" section
4. Wait for SSL certificate status to show "Active" or "Issued"

- Railway automatically provisions SSL via Let's Encrypt
- Usually takes 5-10 minutes after DNS propagates

5. Test the domain:

- Visit `https://habitus.nextstepslab.com/health`
- Should return `{"status":"ok"}`

**Verification:**

- ✅ DNS resolves correctly
- ✅ SSL certificate is active in Railway
- ✅ `https://habitus.nextstepslab.com/health` returns 200 OK
- ✅ No SSL warnings in browser

**STOP HERE** - Verify domain and SSL are working.---

## PHASE 5: Testing & Validation

### Step 5.1: Test Production Deployment

**Action:** Verify all functionality works in production**Test Checklist:**

1. **Health Check**: `https://habitus.nextstepslab.com/health` → Should return `{"status":"ok"}`
2. **Frontend**: `https://habitus.nextstepslab.com` → Should load React app
3. **API Endpoints**: Test a few API calls (e.g., `/api/auth/...`)
4. **Database**: Create a test user account
5. **File Upload**: Upload a profile picture (should use Cloudinary)
6. **Authentication**: Test login/signup flow
7. **Email**: Test magic link email sending (check SMTP works)

**Monitor Logs:**

- Check Railway logs for any errors
- Verify database connections are working
- Verify Cloudinary uploads are working

**Verification:**

- ✅ All core functionality works
- ✅ No critical errors in logs
- ✅ Database operations work
- ✅ File uploads work (check Cloudinary dashboard)

**STOP HERE** - Fix any issues found during testing.---

### Step 5.2: Final Code Quality Checks

**Action:** Ensure code quality requirements are met**Checklist:**

- ✅ Run full test suite: `npm test` (all tests pass)
- ✅ Check for dead code in all modified files
- ✅ Verify all comments are in English with JSDoc style
- ✅ Verify all error messages are in English
- ✅ No console.log statements with sensitive data
- ✅ Environment variables are properly used

**Commands:**

```bash
npm test
npm run lint  # if available
```

**Verification:**

- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ No dead code
- ✅ Code quality standards met

**STOP HERE** - Complete final verification.---

## Development Environment Management

### Automatic Environment Detection

The application will **automatically detect** the environment and use the appropriate services:| Component | Development | Production ||-----------|------------|------------|| **Database** | SQLite (local `.db` file) | PostgreSQL (Railway) || **File Storage** | Local filesystem (`data/uploads/`) | Cloudinary || **Port** | `VITE_PORT` from `.env` | `PORT` from Railway || **Server URL** | `http://localhost:PORT` | `https://habitus.nextstepslab.com` || **Environment Variables** | `config/.env` file | Railway dashboard |

### How It Works

1. **Database**:

- Checks for `DATABASE_URL` → PostgreSQL (Railway) (production)
- Otherwise → SQLite (development)

2. **File Storage**:

- Checks for `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` → Cloudinary (production)
- Otherwise → Local filesystem (development)

3. **Port**:

- Checks for `PORT` → Use it (production)
- Otherwise → Use `VITE_PORT` (development)

### Development Workflow (No Changes Required)

- ✅ Continue using `npm run dev` locally
- ✅ Keep your `config/.env` file with development settings
- ✅ SQLite database continues to work (`data/habitus.db`)
- ✅ Local file uploads continue to work (`data/uploads/`)
- ✅ No need to set Cloudinary or Supabase credentials locally
- ✅ No manual switching between dev/prod configurations

### Production Workflow

- ✅ Railway sets `NODE_ENV=production` automatically (via your env vars)
- ✅ Railway provides `PORT` automatically
- ✅ `DATABASE_URL` must be manually linked from PostgreSQL service to web service (Step 3.1.1)
- ✅ Set Cloudinary credentials in Railway dashboard
- ✅ Set other required env vars in Railway dashboard
- ✅ Application automatically uses production services

## Notes

- **Database**: Railway PostgreSQL (included in Railway, covered by $5/month credit)
- **Development**: SQLite continues to work locally without changes
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary free tier (25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth/month)
- **Development Storage**: Local filesystem (no limits, no account needed)
- **Domain**: habitus.nextstepslab.com subdomain configured in Railway dashboard
- **DNS**: CNAME record at domain registrar pointing to Railway service
- **SSL**: Automatically provisioned by Railway for the subdomain
- **Environment Switching**: Fully automatic - no manual configuration changes needed
- **Railway Free Tier**: $5/month credit, usually free for small apps, always-on (no cold starts)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Errors:**

- Verify PostgreSQL service is created in Railway
- **Most common issue:** `DATABASE_URL` is not linked to your web service
  - Check if `DATABASE_URL` exists in your web service's Variables tab
  - If not, reference it from your PostgreSQL service:
    1. Go to your web service → "Variables" tab
    2. Click "New Variable" → "Add Reference"
    3. Select your PostgreSQL database service
    4. Select `DATABASE_URL`
    5. The value should be: `${{your-db-service-name.DATABASE_URL}}`
  - If Railway doesn't provide `DATABASE_URL` directly, construct it from individual PostgreSQL variables
- Verify PostgreSQL service shows "Active" status in Railway
- Check Railway logs for database connection errors
- Ensure both services are in the same Railway project
- Verify the `DATABASE_URL` reference format: `${{service-name.DATABASE_URL}}`
- Railway will automatically resolve the reference to the actual connection string at runtime

**File Upload Errors:**

- Verify Cloudinary credentials are correct in Railway
- Check Cloudinary dashboard for upload limits
- Verify environment variables are set

**Build Failures:**

- Check build logs in Railway
- Verify all dependencies are in package.json
- Check TypeScript compilation errors

**DNS/SSL Issues:**

- Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)
- Verify DNS record is correct at registrar
- Check SSL certificate status in Railway dashboard
- Railway automatically provisions SSL - wait 5-10 minutes after DNS propagates

**Railway-Specific:**

- Check credit usage in Railway dashboard (Settings → Usage)
