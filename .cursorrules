## Code Style and Best Practices

1. **Object-Oriented Programming**: Use object-oriented programming whenever it's possible. Prefer classes and instances over static functions and procedural code.

2. **Dead Code**: Always check for dead code in the modified files when doing some changes. Remove unused code, functions, and imports.

3. **Error Messages**: Error texts must be in English.

4. **Testing**:

   - Always run all available test suites after changing code.
   - Tests must be in English.
   - Maintain test coverage above 75%.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Always comment in English.
   - Use JSDoc style for comments.
   - Document classes, methods, and complex logic.
